#Gauassian Naive Bayes algorithm
#Naive Bayes is a classification algorithm based on Bayes' Theorem
# Guassian distrobution also known as normal distribution is a bell shaped curve and it is assumed that during any 
# any measurement values will follow a normal distribution  with an equal nummber of measurements above and below the eman value 
# data has to be continuos to attain guassian distribution 
# say we have give some data like height , weight and footsize to check whether the person belong to male category or female 
# we have some sample and data of male features and female features 
# we are assuming that the give data is of normal distribution type
# so firt we calculate prior probabilities for mae and female . it epends on the training data 
# here we have 8  training data samples out of which 4 are male and 4 are female . 
# p(M)=P(F)=4/4+4 =0.5
# now we will calculate mean and standard deviation for male features ie, height , weight and footsize and similarly for women
# now we calculate posterior probability
# posterior(M)= (P(M) *P(H\M)*P(W\M)*P(FS\M))/evidence . h\m means height given the person is male similarly for all
#posterior(F)= (P(F) *P(H\F)*P(W\F)*P(FS\F))/evidence
# to calculate these we will use probability density function
# whose posterior probabilty is bigger the give person belong to that category
