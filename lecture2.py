#lecture 2 in the scikit series is sbout the classification in ML
#Classification is a type of machine learning where the computer learns to sort things into categories or classes.
#Example 1: Email Spam Detection
#You give a computer lots of emails labeled as "spam" or "not spam".
#The machine learns from them and later, when a new email comes in, it can say:
# “This email is spam” or “This email is not spam.”
#Classification = Teaching a computer to recognize and label things.
